## ðŸ“Š Tax Calculation Formula

```javascript
TAX_RATE = 0.12 (12% VAT)

Subtotal = Sum of (Product Quantity Ã— Unit Price)
Delivery Fee = User input
Taxable Amount = Subtotal + Delivery Fee
Tax = Taxable Amount Ã— 0.12
Grand Total = Subtotal + Delivery Fee + Tax
```

**Example:**
- Product A: 10 Ã— â‚±150 = â‚±1,500
- Product B: 5 Ã— â‚±200 = â‚±1,000
- Subtotal: â‚±2,500
- Delivery Fee: â‚±100
- Taxable Amount: â‚±2,600
- **Tax (12%)**: â‚±312.00
- **Grand Total**: â‚±2,912.00
