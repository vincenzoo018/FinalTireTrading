# ✅ INVOICE SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 What Was Created

### **1. Invoice Table (`supplier_invoices`)** ✅
- **Invoice Number**: Auto-generated (INV-2025-0001, INV-2025-0002, etc.)
- **Transaction ID**: Links to supplier transaction
- **Invoice Date**: When invoice was generated
- **Due Date**: Payment due date (30 days default)
- **Amounts**: Subtotal, Tax, Delivery Fee, Total
- **Status**: draft, issued, paid, cancelled
- **Notes**: Optional notes field

### **2. SupplierInvoice Model** ✅
- Auto-generates unique invoice numbers
- Format: `INV-YYYY-####` (e.g., INV-2025-0001)
- Increments automatically per year
- Relationship to SuppTransOrder

### **3. Automatic Invoice Creation** ✅
- Invoice created automatically when transaction is saved
- Invoice number generated
- Due date calculated (30 days)
- All amounts copied from transaction
- Status set to "issued"

---

## 📊 Database Structure

### **supplier_invoices Table**
```sql
- invoice_id (Primary Key)
- invoice_number (Unique, e.g., "INV-2025-0001")
- transaction_id (Foreign Key → supp_trans_orders)
- invoice_date (Date)
- due_date (Date)
- subtotal (Decimal)
- tax (Decimal)
- delivery_fee (Decimal)
- total_amount (Decimal)
- status (Enum: draft/issued/paid/cancelled)
- notes (Text, nullable)
- created_at
- updated_at
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Creating a Transaction**
```
1. Admin creates transaction
   ↓
2. System creates SuppTransOrder
   ↓
3. System creates SuppOrderProds (items)
   ↓
4. System creates StockProd (if delivered)
   ↓
5. ✨ System auto-creates SupplierInvoice ✨
   - Generates invoice number (INV-2025-0001)
   - Sets invoice date = today
   - Sets due date = today + 30 days
   - Copies all amounts
   - Sets status = "issued"
   ↓
6. Success message shows invoice number
```

### **Viewing Invoice**
```
1. Click invoice icon in transactions table
   ↓
2. System loads transaction with invoice
   ↓
3. If no invoice exists (old data):
   - System creates invoice automatically
   ↓
4. Invoice page displays:
   ✓ Invoice number (INV-2025-0001)
   ✓ Invoice date & due date
   ✓ Reference number
   ✓ Order date
   ✓ Delivery status & date
   ✓ Product images
   ✓ All amounts
```

   ↓
4. Fallback: SVG placeholder "No Image"

4. **See success message**: "Invoice #INV-2025-0001 generated"
5. Transaction appears in table ✅

### **Test 2: View Invoice**
1. Click invoice icon (📋) in any transaction
2. **Check Header**:
   - Invoice Number: INV-2025-0001 ✅
   - Invoice Date: Today's date ✅
   - Due Date: 30 days from today ✅
3. **Check Delivery Info**:
   - If Received: Shows "✓ Received" + Delivery Date ✅

   - All product details show ✅

### **Test 3: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT * FROM supplier_invoices;
```
Should see:

- transaction_id: Links to transaction
- invoice_date: Today
- due_date: 30 days ahead
- All amounts match transaction

### **Test 4: Print Invoice**

## 🎯 Invoice Number Format

### **Auto-Generation Logic**
```
INV-YYYY-####

Examples:
- INV-2025-0001 (First invoice of 2025)
- INV-2025-0002 (Second invoice)
- INV-2025-0999 (999th invoice)
- INV-2026-0001 (First invoice of 2026 - resets yearly)
```

### **How It Works**
1. Get current year
2. Find last invoice of current year
3. Extract number from invoice_number
4. Increment by 1
5. Pad with zeros to 4 digits
6. Format: INV-{year}-{number}
