# Booking Availability & Product Stock Status Fixes

## Overview
Fixed two key issues in the customer-facing application:
1. **Service Bookings** - Removed restriction preventing customers from booking the same service multiple times
2. **Product Stock Status** - Added real-time stock indicators showing when products are out of stock

---

## 1. Service Booking Availability Fix

### Problem
Previously, customers were prevented from booking a service if they already had a pending or confirmed booking for that service. This was too restrictive.

### Solution
Services are now always available for booking (as long as the service itself is marked as available). Customers can book the same service multiple times.

### Changes Made

#### `app/Models/Service.php`
- **Updated `isAvailableForUser()` method**
  - Old: Checked if user had existing pending/confirmed bookings
  - New: Only checks if service is marked as available (`is_available` field)
  - Customers can now book the same service multiple times

- **Added `getUserActiveBookingsCount()` method**
  - Returns count of user's active bookings for this service
  - Can be used for display purposes if needed

#### `resources/views/customer/services.blade.php`
- **Removed "unavailable" state styling**
  - Removed `service-unavailable` CSS class
  - Removed "Already Booked" badge
  - Removed "You already have a booking for this service" message

- **Updated availability display**
  - Now shows "Available" (green) or "Not Available" (red) based only on `is_available` field
  - All available services show "Book Now" button
  - Unavailable services show "Not Available" button (disabled)

### Result
✅ Customers can book any available service multiple times
✅ Only the service's `is_available` field controls availability
✅ Cleaner, simpler booking flow

## 2. Product Stock Status Indicators

### Problem
Products didn't show stock status. Customers could attempt to add out-of-stock items to cart.

### Solution
Added real-time stock indicators with three states:
- **In Stock** (green badge) - Product has 10+ items
- **Low Stock** (yellow badge) - Product has 1-9 items
- **Out of Stock** (red badge + overlay) - Product has 0 items

### Changes Made

#### `app/Models/Product.php`
Added three new methods:

1. **`getStockQuantity()`**
   - Returns current stock quantity from inventory
   - Returns 0 if no inventory record exists

2. **`isInStock()`**
   - Returns true if stock quantity > 0
   - Used to enable/disable "Add to Cart" button

3. **`isLowStock()`**
   - Returns true if stock is between 1-9 items
   - Shows warning badge to customers

#### `app/Http/Controllers/Customer/ProductController.php`
- **Added eager loading of inventory**
  - Changed `Product::query()` to `Product::with('inventory')`
  - Prevents N+1 query issues
  - Loads inventory data for all products in one query

#### `resources/views/customer/products.blade.php`
- **Updated product card display**
  - Added conditional CSS class `product-out-of-stock`
  - Shows stock quantity in product specs (replaces "Category")
  - Stock number is color-coded (green/red)

- **Added stock status badges**
  - **In Stock**: Green badge with checkmark
  - **Low Stock**: Yellow badge with warning icon
  - **Out of Stock**: Red badge with X icon

- **Added out-of-stock overlay**
  - Large "OUT OF STOCK" badge overlays product image
  - Semi-transparent with shadow effect
  - Image is grayscaled for out-of-stock products

- **Conditional "Add to Cart" button**
  - Enabled for in-stock products
  - Replaced with disabled "Out of Stock" button when quantity is 0

- **Added CSS styling**
  - `.product-out-of-stock` - Reduces opacity, grayscales image
  - `.out-of-stock-overlay` - Centers overlay badge on product image
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Result
✅ Customers can see stock status at a glance
✅ Cannot add out-of-stock items to cart
✅ Low stock warnings help create urgency
✅ Professional, polished UI with visual indicators

## Database Requirements

### Inventory Table
The product stock feature relies on the `inventories` table with:
- `product_id` (foreign key to products)
- `quantity` (integer, current stock level)

Make sure inventory records exist for products to display accurate stock levels.
