# 🎉 SUPPLIER TRANSACTION - COMPLETE REDESIGN

## 📋 Overview

I've completely redesigned the **Supplier Transaction** interface from a basic form-based system to a modern **4-step wizard** with interactive controls and automatic StockProd integration.

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### **Understanding the Stock Flow**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SUPPLIER TRANSACTION FLOW                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 1: CREATE SUPPLIER ORDER (SuppTransOrder + SuppOrderProd)
   │
   ├─ Admin places order with supplier
   ├─ Records: Reference #, Order Date, Products, Quantities
   ├─ Status: Pending (delivery_received = 0)
   │
   ▼
   
Step 2: DELIVERY RECEIVED? 
   │
   ├─ YES (delivery_received = 1)
   │  │
   │  ├─ Creates SuppTransOrder record
   │  ├─ Creates SuppOrderProd records
   │  └─ ✅ AUTOMATICALLY CREATES StockProd records
   │     │
   │     └─ Stock is now in StockProd (available to add to Inventory)
   │
   └─ NO (delivery_received = 0)
      │
      ├─ Creates SuppTransOrder record
      ├─ Creates SuppOrderProd records
      └─ ❌ NO StockProd created (waiting for delivery)

Step 3: ADD TO INVENTORY (from StockProd → Inventory)
   │
   ├─ Admin goes to "Add Stock" in Inventory
   ├─ Selects products from StockProd
   ├─ Adds quantities to Inventory
   └─ StockProd quantity is deducted
```

## 💾 Database Integration

### **Tables Involved**

1. **`supp_trans_orders`** (Supplier Transaction Orders)
   - Main transaction record
   - Fields: reference_num, order_date, delivery_date, delivery_received, tax, sub_total, overall_total, supplier_id

2. **`supp_order_prods`** (Supplier Order Products)
   - Line items for each transaction
   - Fields: transaction_id, product_id, quantity, total

3. **`stock_prods`** (Stock from Suppliers)
   - **ONLY created if delivery_received = 1**
   - Represents physical stock available to add to inventory
   - Fields: supplier_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, total_cost, date, status

4. **`inventories`** (Retail Inventory)
   - Added separately via "Add Stock" feature
   - Deducts from `stock_prods` when added

---

## 🔧 Backend Logic

### **SupplierTransactionController::store()**

```php
DB::beginTransaction();
try {
    // 1. Create SuppTransOrder
    $transaction = SuppTransOrder::create([...]);
    
    // 2. Create SuppOrderProd for each item
    foreach ($items as $item) {
        SuppOrderProd::create([...]);
        
        // 3. IF delivery received, create StockProd
        if ($deliveryReceived) {
            StockProd::create([
                'supplier_id' => $supplierId,
                'product_id' => $item['product_id'],
                'quantity' => $item['quantity'],
                'unit_price' => calculated,
                'total_cost' => $item['total'],
                'status' => 'In Stock'
            ]);
        }
    }
    
    DB::commit();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    DB::rollBack();
}
```

3. Enter details, select "Received", set delivery date → Next
4. Use +/- buttons to set quantities → Next

6. ✅ **Result**: Transaction created + StockProd records created
7. Go to Inventory → "Add Stock" to move stock to retail inventory

### **Scenario 2: Delivery Not Yet Received**
1. Click "New Transaction"
2. Select supplier → Next
3. Enter details, select "Pending", set estimated date → Next
4. Use +/- buttons to set quantities → Next
