## 🔐 Access Requirements

### Who Can Book Services?

**All authenticated customers (role_id = 3)** can book services.

### Authentication Check
```php
// Automatic check in ServiceController
if (!Auth::check() || Auth::user()->role_id != 3) {
    return redirect()->route('login')
        ->withErrors(['auth' => 'Please login as a customer to view services.']);
}
```

---

## 📋 How It Works

### 1. **View Services** (`/customer/services`)

**Route**: `customer.services`  
**Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Customer\ServiceController@index`  
**View**: `resources/views/customer/services.blade.php`

**Features**:
- ✅ Display all services with availability status
- ✅ Show service price, description, and employee
- ✅ Filter and search functionality
- ✅ "Book Now" button for available services
- ✅ Visual indicators for availability

**Service Availability**:
```php
// In Service Model
public function isAvailableForUser($userId)
{
    // Service is available as long as it's marked as available
    // Users can book the same service multiple times
    return $this->is_available;
}
```

### 2. **Book a Service** (Modal)

**Features**:
- ✅ Service summary with price
- ✅ Customer information (auto-filled)
- ✅ Date picker (minimum: today)
- ✅ Time slot selection
- ✅ Payment method selection
- ✅ Card payment details (if applicable)
- ✅ Special requests/notes field

**Payment Methods**:
- Cash
- GCash
- Credit Card
- Debit Card

**Validation**:
```php
$validated = $request->validate([
    'service_id' => 'required|exists:services,service_id',
    'booking_date' => 'required|date|after_or_equal:today',
    'booking_time' => 'required',
    'payment_method' => 'nullable|string|in:Cash,GCash,Credit Card,Debit Card',
    'notes' => 'nullable|string|max:1000',
    'card_number' => 'required_if:payment_method,Credit Card,Debit Card',
    'card_name' => 'required_if:payment_method,Credit Card,Debit Card',
    'card_expiry' => 'required_if:payment_method,Credit Card,Debit Card',
    'card_cvv' => 'required_if:payment_method,Credit Card,Debit Card',
]);
```

### 3. **Booking Submission**

**Route**: `POST /customer/booking`  
**Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Customer\BookingController@store`

**Process**:
1. Validate booking data
2. Get service details
3. Create booking record (status: pending)
4. Process payment
5. Create payment record
6. Redirect to booking list with success message

**Booking Record**:
```php
Booking::create([
    'user_id' => Auth::id(),
    'service_id' => $validated['service_id'],
    'booking_date' => $validated['booking_date'],
    'booking_time' => $validated['booking_time'],
    'payment_method' => $validated['payment_method'] ?? 'Cash',
    'notes' => $validated['notes'] ?? null,
    'status' => 'pending',
    'payment_status' => 'paid',
]);
```

**Payment Record**:
```php
Payment::create([
    'user_id' => Auth::id(),
    'order_id' => null,
    'booking_id' => $booking->booking_id,
    'amount' => $service->service_price,
    'payment_method' => $paymentMethod,
    'payment_status' => 'completed',
    'transaction_id' => 'TXN-' . strtoupper(Str::random(12)),
    'payment_details' => $paymentDetails,
    'payment_date' => now(),
]);
```

### 4. **View Bookings** (`/customer/booking`)

**Route**: `customer.booking`  
**Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Customer\BookingController@index`  
**View**: `resources/views/customer/booking.blade.php`

**Features**:
- ✅ List all user's bookings
- ✅ Filter by status (All, Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Cancelled)
- ✅ View booking details
- ✅ Service information
- ✅ Status badges
- ✅ Action buttons based on status

### 5. **Booking Actions**

#### Cancel Booking
**Route**: `POST /customer/booking/{booking}/cancel`  
**Requirements**:
- Booking must belong to the user
- Status must be "pending"

```php
public function cancel(Booking $booking, Request $request)
{
    if ($booking->status !== 'pending') {
        return back()->withErrors(['booking' => 'Only pending bookings can be cancelled.']);
    }
    
    $booking->status = 'cancelled';
    $booking->save();
    
    return back()->with('success', 'Booking cancelled.');
}
```

#### Mark as Completed
**Route**: `POST /customer/booking/{booking}/completed`  
**Requirements**:
- Booking must belong to the user
- Status must be "confirmed"

```php
public function markCompleted(Booking $booking)
{
    if (!in_array($booking->status, ['confirmed'])) {
        return back()->withErrors(['booking' => 'Only confirmed bookings can be marked as completed.']);
    }
    
    $booking->status = 'completed';
    $booking->served_date = now();
    $booking->save();
    
    // Create sale record
    Sale::create([...]);
    
    return back()->with('success', 'Booking marked as completed and sale recorded.');
}
```

## 📊 Booking Status Flow

```
1. PENDING (Customer creates booking)
   ↓

   OR
   
   CANCELLED (Customer cancels OR Admin rejects)
```
